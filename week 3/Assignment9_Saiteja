It's high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def has_numerical_value(line):\n","    return any(char.isdigit() for char in line)\n","\n","def check_numerical_values_in_file(file_path):\n","    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","        lines = file.readline().split('.')\n","\n","        for line_number, line in enumerate(lines, 1):\n","            if has_numerical_value(line):\n","                print(f\"Line {line_number} in paragraph contains numerical values: {line.strip()}\")\n","\n","file_path = 'numeric.txt'\n","check_numerical_values_in_file(file_path)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UBxDFQvGEel0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705577261351,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":417,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Teja","userId":"03866594505487991622"}},"outputId":"b0de4811-e73d-4a57-d6b8-00be9fcc5ae4"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Line 2 in paragraph contains numerical values: I am 22 years old\n","Line 3 in paragraph contains numerical values: I have completed 4 years of Btech\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"9OrBxaH3Kmea"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
